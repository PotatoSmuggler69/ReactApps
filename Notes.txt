Make sure you have Node installed 
Link : https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer

npm --> Node Package Manager

npx --> Node package Executor

HOW TO initialize a React App : https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project

(SLOW BUT PRESENT IN MOST documentation)

>> npx create-react-app <name_of_the_app>

Here create-react-app is an utility which is very heavy and thus it takes a large amount of time for installation.

(WE CAN FAST-TRACK the react app building type with Vite or Parcel)

Vite   :   https://vitejs.dev/
Parcel :   https://parceljs.org/

With Vite : (It is tool for making light weight development environments for developing a react project with minimal pre-install dependencies)
STEP:
 >> npm create vite@latest
 
 npm ----------> Node Package Manager
 create -------> is an utility
 vite@latest --> Command for creating the latest vire project

ONE thing to remember if "node_modules" directory is abscent in a vite project we should use :
 >> npm install 
It downloads all the node modules.


THINGS TO KNOW FOR NOOBS

1. packages.json (notice it first)
    a) It contains the scipts like
        1. start (used for running the project)
        2. build (it is used for building the project just like the compile button)
        3. test
        4. eject

        How to run a scipt ?
            >> npm run start
            >> npm run build
